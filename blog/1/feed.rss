 <title>Decoding the Credit Score: Part 2</title>
 <link>https://www.faircent.com/decoding-the-credit-score-part-2</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faircent Bureau&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	While in the previous article, the bare basics of credit score were explained. This installment will further decode your credit score to explain various factors that impact it. Corporate demand for loans has shrunk recently and financial institutions are now focusing more on consumer and personal loan segments. Hence, a good credit score goes a long way to improve the chances of securing a loan at a cheaper rate of interest.&lt;br /&gt;
	To hold a good credit score, individuals need to maintain a thorough credit history which shows up in the repayment track. Depending on your diligence and discipline in repayment, the credit score improves and grades better against those who do not repay timely. Faircent encourages all its borrowers to repay the loans on time and prevent repayment delays as it has negative impact on their financial scorecard.&lt;br /&gt;
	Now, it is essential to understand how the various factors contribute to credit score and what you need to do to keep it as high as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;strong&gt;1. The repayment history (35%): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		This is the first and most crucial component that accounts for 35% impact on the credit score. All loans have to be repaid. All bills have to be paid and that too within the stipulated time period without delay to have an impeccable repayment track record. Every single default has a strong negative impact on your score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;strong&gt;2. The amount you owe to lenders (30%): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		The credit utilization has two important factors that determine your ability to secure a loan. Number one is the total credit card amount sanctioned to you and what percentage of it is being utilized. The credit utilization ratio is the balance of outstanding on all credit cards as a percentage of aggregated credit limit on all your credit cards. The loan application becomes riskier as this ratio goes upwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;strong&gt;3. Number of years of servicing debt (15%)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		There is an old saying: A person with on credit history is riskier than person with not-so-good credit history. It might surprise many but the amount of time a person has been servicing debt also contributes to the credit score. This is a very good long term indictor of handling credit responsibly. Hence, the number of years of credit history in conjunction with timely repayments has a positive impact on the credit score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;strong&gt;4. Number and amount of recent loans taken or applied for (10%): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Every new application for a loan or a credit card etc. leads to financial institutions running a credit check to assess the financial health and repayment behavior. Too many inquires or availing loans in quick succession display a credit hungry behavior and negatively impact the credit score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;strong&gt;5. The Credit Mix (10%):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		This is generation fuelled by EMIs even though we have traditionally been a credit averse society. Avoiding credit like a plague or using only one type of credit line is never a good decision when it comes to positive impact on the credit score. For a positive contribution from this parameter it is helpful to have a balanced mix of secured or unsecured credit lines such as consumer loan, vehicle loan, personal loan, credit card etc. including servicing them timely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;	Now that the components of a credit score have been decoded, it would be helpful in assessing ways to improve it further. Explore areas where you are lagging and use this information to positively impact your credit score. A good credit score contributes a long way to get the loan at the cheapest possible interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Decoding the Credit Score: Part 1</title>
 <link>https://www.faircent.com/decoding-the-credit-score-part-1</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faircent Bureau In the current Indian economy, credit has played a very crucial role in fulfilling dreams on consumers such as owning a house, car, improving the house and so on. You name a requirement and there is credit available in the market to fund it. Just because someone is willing to lend, it does not mean that you can get the loan. Lending behaviour has evolved over a period of time from checking a borrower’s income to his past repayment history in form of credit score before disbursing funds. Given this scenario, a bad credit score is a crucial reason for not securing a loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you wish to prevent a last moment rejection it might help to understand the meaning of a credit score, and how to have a good score to establish your credentials. A credit score is an indicator of a borrower’s willingness to repay the loan on time. Loan assessment by a lender is mostly driven by two factor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		1. Ability to repay: That is your income and its utilization pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		2. Intention to repay: Willingness to repay loan. A higher credit score implies higher intention to repay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;	The most popular credit score that comes to mind in India is CIBIL. However, there are three other credit bureaus that evaluate your credit worthiness, namely Equifax, Experian and Crif High Mark. As on date, all credit bureaus provide scores ranging from 300 to 900. An individual with no credit history has a default score of -1. The credit agencies charge a fee to let you access your score. A higher credit score is always desirable. However, different lenders have different risk appetites.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; At Faircent, we classify the borrowers into different risk buckets and we have seen lenders show interest in borrowers across entire risk spectrum. Thus, being a marketplace we allow different lenders to lend as per their risk appetite. However, if lenders are ready to offer loans despite &lt;strong&gt;low credit scores&lt;/strong&gt; then they will charge a &lt;strong&gt;higher rate of interest &lt;/strong&gt;to compensate for risk of repayment. Thus, the loan availed would be a costly transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Many times, the lenders do not provide correct information to the credit bureau about loan repayment which can result in a bad score. To ensure that Lenders inform credit account performance across all bureaus and the score is error free, you can raise a dispute resolution with these agencies so that discrepancy in information can be rectified and your credit score  improves. This will enhance your chances of securing loan at a reduced rate of interest, thereby, saving money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
