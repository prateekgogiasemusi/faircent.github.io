    </figure>
    <p>The year 2016 was remarkable for me in a lot of ways. On a personal level, my startup was operational and we were taking small steps in getting business. However, what completely took me by surprise was how the entire fintech scene took off last year. In January 2016 it would have been hard to imagine the ‘fintech’ as a term would part of the mainstream.</p>

<p>What led to this has been a combination or many events, but the opportunities that we have in 2017 is what dreams are made of.</p>

<p>Firstly, the P2P lending business is bound to see greater interest and traction from lenders. With the real estate market being subdued, economic uncertainty playing out in the stock markets, and opaqueness around gold, we will see people increasingly looking at alternate sources of finance as an investment tool. The demonetisation exercise has meant returns from bank deposits are at some of its lowest levels, which means as the word gets out, P2P lending will emerge as the most prominent alternative investment opportunity. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On the borrower side, things are grim. This is particularly true for SMEs who have been squeezed hard by demonetisation and loans from banks have come to almost a screeching halt. This year demand for business loans is expected to grow. SMEs and MSMEs will look at alternative investments to fuel growth and would be the biggest beneficiary of P2P lending due to faster and cheaper access to credit.&nbsp;It is uncannily difficult to raise loans from a bank and it has become tougher. Last year, 34% of our borrowers used their loan to expand and fund their businesses, creating more jobs and adding to the growth of our economy. We expect this part of borrowing to grow considerably for the entire P2P sector, both in terms of percentage and volume.</p>

<p>One grey area for the sector has been the lack of guidelines and regulator provisions. Last year the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had put out a consultation paper on P2P lending in India. The paper proposes NBFCs status for P2P lending platforms and is largely in line with what the sector has been asking for.&nbsp; The guidelines are progressive and does a lot to safeguard the interest of everyone involved, and at the same time not stifling innovation. Sometime during the year we can expect the guidelines to become regulations, which will then give a major fillip to the sector. Expected post budget, this will be a major milestone to boost lender and borrower confidence.</p>

<p>On the funding side, the fintech sector has been hot. According to Tracxn, about $512 million has been pumped into the fintech space in India last year. However, Mobile payments ($212M) and Lending ($199M) accounted for a major part of it and P2P has not seen a great deal of funding activity. However, with the sector notching up impressive growth numbers and the existence of exciting players, we will surely see this going up this year. Investor sentiment is expected to be upbeat for P2P lending, and we should see a greater amount of money flowing in.</p>

<p>The launch of India-stack, the move towards a cashless economy and current government policies favor fintech sector. This will pave the way for greater innovation and ultimately products that can change the way we deal with money. In 2017 expect a digital play to every aspect of monetary transactions and a bid to make transactions seamless for both borrowers and lenders.&nbsp;However, I also suspect there will be greater levels of resistance from traditional financial institutions. We are already seeing that play out with apps running on UPI and I expect a certain level of conflict between banks and fintech disruptors.</p>

<p>What has also been noteworthy for this very nascent sector has been the level of cooperation. Each startup maybe a competitor, but that has not stopped the sector from getting together to come up with what is best for the sector. The P2Plenders have initiated talks to form an association and the aim is to not just jointly represent the industry, but also to mutually cooperate for borrower and lender interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greater interaction and co-operation between players expected as the industry grows and in 2017, we will see this play out even more forcefully.&nbsp;</p>
