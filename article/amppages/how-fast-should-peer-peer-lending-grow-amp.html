    <p>Of late, I have often questioned myself if P2P lending in India is growing fast enough or can we grow faster? Or should we grow at breakneck speeds seen in sectors like transportation that propelled the likes of Ola and Uber into stratosphere? &nbsp;The answer may be no, primarily because we are talking about peoples’ money. It is quite easy to lend money, but the key is, it should come back to the lender on time and he should earn something on it. I believe this sector should grow in a calibrated way and not get caught in aggressive and no holds barred lending spree. The GMV euphoria witnessed by the e-commerce companies or the rush to build ‘Loan Book’ by banks and NBFCs during the pre- 2008-09 years &nbsp;should not be the yardstick to judge the space.</p>

<p>The Indian P2P space, in fact continues to grow steadily and see good traction. While there are no official figures, if one has to extrapolate our figures, we have grown eight times in the last six months in our loan disbursals.</p>

<p>In fact, this is true for the entire Fintech space. In 2015 the space exploded, but it has not shown signs of weakening. According to a Tracxn and Blume Ventures report about $103 million was raised across 22 rounds in 2015 in the Fintech space. About halfway through the year, 2016 has seen $68million being raised and if this trend continues, this year would be better than last year. Compared to 2013 when only $4 million was raised and 2014 when $18 million was raised, the sector has grown leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>The report states that the big boys of the investing world, including the likes of Sequoia Capital, Accion, Apsada Investments, SAIF Partners, and Walden International are the most active investors in Alternative Lending in India.</p>

<p>What is impressive to note in the report is that deals in 2016 include a wide range of startups that include loan comparison platforms, commercial loan provider, and consumer loan providers. This means growth is across the sector and not concentrated around a few ideas, thereby making it too hot.</p>

<p><strong>What’s fuelling the steady growth?</strong></p>

<p>It is important to understand that the P2P sector in India is still at a very early stage when compared to a country like the US and the UK. Any new concept takes time to find its roots and for people to understand. P2P has been well accepted by the masses- in the major cities of the country and also in smaller towns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is also important to note that growth of a sector is best when it is gradual and based on real economics. Growth pumped up by adrenaline shots only skew a sector.</p>

<p>P2P lending is benefitting from the economic conditions on the ground. An Economic Times report points out that for the first time since March 2011, the country's consumer durables sector witnessed three months of consecutive double-digit growth during the festival season last year. Banks grew their personal loan portfolio by 17.3% year-on-year in August 2015 compared with 12.8% a year ago. The same is reflected in our borrowings. A loan to buy consumer durables is a major part of our loan outgo and that has seen a steady growth. So, unlike the western countries where consumption patterns have slowed on the back of bleak economic conditions, our domestic demand for goods and services remain intact. Add to that the vast unbanked and the underbanked population in the country, the P2P space has a lot to cover.</p>

<p>Another aspect of P2P loan is the borrowings made to start a business. The government’s key focus around Make in India and Startup India has meant people’s entrepreneurial ambitions have been spurred and most now dream of having their own business. It is significantly easier to get a business loan from a P2P platform and we are seeing large demand stemming from this segment.</p>

<p>Building real businesses and creating a new category takes year. It took years for the like of Flipkart and Snapdeal to create the e-commerce culture in India and same would be the case with P2P companies.&nbsp; Till now there have been no reports of any ponzi schemes and operators in the space have proactively pushed for regulations. Once the draft guidelines circulated by the RBI becomes a reality, there is scope for greater structured growth.</p>

<p><strong>Global comparisons:</strong></p>

<p>P2P in the country is often compared to the what is happening in or already happened in countries like the US, UK and even China. Growth rates are often compared to determine if India is a lucrative market and likewise people try to find chinks in the space if something comes up in another country.</p>

<p>LendingClub, which has been the poster boy for P2P lending in the US, found itself in a fiasco early in the year after it was discovered it has sold an investor $22 million in loans that went against the investor’s instructions. The fallout saw the company’s CEO Renaud Laplanche being fired. This, however, is more of a corporate issue and does not pose a systemic risk to the sector. In fact LedingClub seems to be back on track and business seems to be picking up for them.</p>

<p>There is also the case of a Chinese platform, where a ponzi scheme was being run under the garb of P2P lending, duping investors of their money. That again is a classic case of unscrupulous operators’ rushing to cheat people when regulations were missing and oversight on the part of authorities was completely missing. In India things are very different and I see very little chance of this happening.</p>

<p>Critics in India argue that the regulatory risks still hangs over the sector along with risks associated with lending. However, I think most of these fears are unconfounded as there are inherent risks in any business. What should be heartening is the fact that P2P in the country has made the right start and the right amount of noise. What also helps is that in the world’s fastest growing major economy, confidence is not in short supply.</p>
