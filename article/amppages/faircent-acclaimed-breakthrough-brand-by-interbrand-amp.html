    <p align="center"><strong>Interbrand launched the Interbrand Breakthrough Brands report 2016 in partnership with Facebook, Ready Set Rocket, and NYSE</strong></p>

<p class="rtejustify">Faircent.com, India’s largest peer to peer lending marketplace has been acclaimed as the ‘Interbrand Breakthrough Brand in Finance’ by <a href="http://interbrand.com/" target="_blank">Interbrand</a>. The inaugural Breakthrough Brands report is in partnership with Facebook, Ready Set Rocket and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).</p>

<p>Faircent.com is the only P2P lending marketplace and alternative lending platform globally in the Interbrand Breakthrough Brands report. Around 200 brands were nominated by a global network of key influencers—individuals chosen by <strong>Interbrand, Facebook, NYSE and Ready Set Rocket</strong>. The report features brands that are accelerating the rate of innovation and problem solving, and are setting the pace for growth. Of the 200 brands nominated globally, 60 are featured in the Interbrand Breakthrough Brands report. Some of the big ones are WeChat, MPesa, Xiaomi and Maple. Only two other brands from India are in the list Zomato &amp; Paytm.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/default/files/Facebook%20Cover%20Picture%20-%20Revised.jpg" style="width: 1200px; height: 456px;" />Speaking on the recognition, Mr. Rajat Gandhi, Founder and CEO, Faircent.com said, “Normally consumer brands are associated with high levels of advertising spends which tends to colour a brand's intrinsic strength, this recognition is the true testimony of the way our customers are interacting and deriving value from the brand at various touch points. This is a strong validation of the product &amp; technology platform we have built.”</p>

<p>The Breakthrough Brands report, entitled 'Future Growth’ examines emerging companies that are brand-led—organizations that have both unique business models and strong brands. The report complements Interbrand’s annual Best Global Brands report putting a spotlight on emerging brands—especially those that are affecting change and embodying growth.</p>

<p>The report says “Money makes the world go round, but the way we talk about money today is alien to the way we did even a decade ago. Digital and mobile personal finance has broken through to the mainstream, revolutionizing how we think about currency. Breakthrough Brands are growing our financial options and offering clever new ways to get our money to work harder. Whether it’s by making credit achievable in high-interest markets, helping us to invest or save smarter, or letting us lend money to one another, these brands are growing faster than, and outmaneuvering, financial giants. Once one of the most impenetrable industries, emerging brands are breaking down traditional ideas about finance, making it more transparent, comprehensible, and customer-centric.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically speaking about FAIRCENT the report says ‘India’s Faircent offers peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, eliminating the high margins that intermediaries charge on transactions. P2P lenders have revolutionized access to credit in India and elsewhere, and Faircent is leading the way in democratizing financial services around the globe.’</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brands featured in Interbrand report are breaking through the 95 Growth Barrier—‘they are the ones that will impact future generations, define progress, and change their markets and categories. This is a celebration of the next generation of brands—the startups, upstarts, challengers, problem-solvers, innovators, and category creators. These are the brands that are the evidence of how our cultures, behaviors, and planet evolve. The ones that will impact generations and define progress.’&nbsp;as per the report by Interbrand.</p>
