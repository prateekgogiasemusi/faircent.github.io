    <p>For all the pros and cons being argued around demonetization and what has followed, there is absolutely no doubt that the move has been a big positive for the fintech sector in the country.</p>

<p>This is particularly true for mobile wallet companies, with every player reporting a huge surge in volume and number of users. Unexpected as it may be, the demonetization of Rs. 500 and Rs 1000 from the economy has given a fillip to the very nascent fintech sector in the country.</p>

<p>Fintech is hardly half a decade old in the country and most startups in the sector entered the business to disrupt, provide an alternative to banks and make life simpler. While disruption is a function of innovation, fintech in India has been able to provide an alternative to banks and at the same time make life simpler for countless Indians facing a cash crunch.</p>

<p>Being cashless:</p>

<p>If you land at Heathrow airport in London, chances are, you can carry out a day’s transaction of getting to the city, getting food and sundry without having to pay in cash. London, with its big banks and innovative startups, is at the heart of the fintech revolution. Wide adoption by the banking system, which considers the sector as a value add and enthusiastic response from consumers have meant startups ranging from robo advisors, marketplace lenders and blockchain technology firms have flourished.</p>

<p>Fintech is much like the social networking site. If there are only 100 people using a financial solution, there would be very less incentive for someone to transact or use the system. As more and people start using it, the value proposition becomes better for everyone. What demonetization has done is get many more people, who would have been otherwise averse to using many of these solutions, to try things out. It has suddenly become easier to find a person who is using a mobile wallet and carry out transactions compared to two weeks back. With greater adoption, there would be greater understanding of technology and thus greater avenues for innovative products to spin out.</p>

<p>With this big push by the government in my mind the biggest hindrance in going cashless is not technology or access to plastic but consumer behavior. Consumers do not like to pre-pay on e-commerce sites as none of them offer blanket like in US ‘no-questions’ asked refund policy. Consumers do not trust keeping money in digital wallets or spending through credit cards, as they fear wrong billing and opaque dispute resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Moneybags:</p>

<p>India’s fintech sector has seen good interest from investors, but we can certainly do with more. According to a latest CB Insights report, across the world fintech funding has declined this year. However, data points that India has seen greater investor interest. In a country like India, the needs of the financial structure are so huge that a disruptive technology can prove to be very successful. What the current demonetization does is it proves to investors and commentators that fintech in the country can make a difference. Currently, fintech companies are doing well to step in and provide ways and means for the citizen of the country to transact.</p>

<p>Caution ahead:</p>

<p>Demonetization is a very big move, which will surely have profound impact. In the coming months we would know how it pans out, but the fintech industry should only consider this as a trigger. Management books are flush with lessons on why the “pull” strategy of getting customers is a much better way of expanding your business as compared to “push”. Pull towards a product or service happens when customers find value in what is being offered. On the other hand the push strategy is not a good indicator of value being created and can be, for example, because of discounts or marketing initiatives. For us in the fintech sector, it is important to understand that a large majority of people looking at fintech solutions today have been forced into its adoption. When cash in the economy returns to normal, would the same people stop transacting on the fintech platforms? The question we need to ask is how do we provide them value so that they see benefit in what we have to offer. This is a great windfall for the Fintech industry ‘Pull” can only be generated if we start investing in building trust to retain these new customers.</p>

<p>External push or a landmark situation as the one we find ourselves in is welcome, but the sector should be driven with an aim to provide value. If you show value, people would adopt.</p>

<p>For starters, our assumptions, as a sector, have been validated. Fintech platforms can form a new financial system that can supplement and run parallel to existing monetary systems. What demonetization should provide is further impetus to that thought and the need to innovate.</p>
