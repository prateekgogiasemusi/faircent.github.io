    <p>In a country where getting institutional credit is often difficult, time consuming and filled with complex regulation, slowly but steadily crowdfunding companies are gaining popularity in India.</p>

<p>While in the US and Europe crowdfunding lending platforms like Lending Club, Zopa and Prosper are an established part of the financial ecosystem, back home crowd funding is the buzz words that the modern day investor is coming to terms with.</p>

<p>While crowdlending or peer to peer lending (P2P Lending) as it is popularly referred to is a smart way of investing idle funds and in turn earning higher returns than bank deposits at a relatively low and moderate risk, a lender needs to exercise caution. It is very important to understand that while any one can be a lender on a crowdfunding site, there are certain checks and balances. Lending on a crowdfunding platform is not a get-rich-quick scheme and a means to avoid the taxation system of the country. A genuine crowdfunding site works within the framework of the prevailing law and complies with all legal requirements and steps.</p>

<p>The P2P Lending market in India is nascent and hence a lender has to make an informed decision and do some basic homework before jumping in. To make the best investment out of alternative funding a few simple tips can help a novice navigate the field of crowdfunding lending.</p>

<p>1. Choose the right platform: Alternative finance is still relatively a new phenomenon and many new companies are joining the bandwagon. It is better to research online and figure out the companies which are professional and transparent. Look for a platform that has a strong support system and follows the ecosystem adopted by leading banks. This adds on to the benefit of being associated with a leading and recognized player in the market.</p>

<p>2.Plan wisely: Crowd lending is one of the many tools in which an investor can divest his funds. However, overall financial planning helps in a balanced approach towards achieving long term financial goals. Proper financial planning is the key to accomplishing good returns on savings, beating inflation and maintaining financial security in difficult times.</p>

<p>3. Maintaining a healthy risk to return: Always look for a platform that has some of underwriting, background and document verification process that tracks the type of risk a particular borrower's credit and financial background entails. Although higher risk can fetch higher returns, a judicious mix of risk can fetch very good returns as compared to traditional methods of investment.</p>

<p>4. Diversification is the key: It is important to note that a genuine p2p lending platform always has investor protection in mind. Dealing in unsecured loans requires tact and a good platform should be able to provide for all necessary steps to ensure that the funds invested on borrowers through the website are safeguarded. Ideally a lender should look at investing only about 20% of his total investment money on a single borrower. This ensures that the lender is diversifying his funds amongst different borrowers and lowering his risk.Target 100 borrowers. Invest small amounts across large number of borrowers.</p>

<p>5. Invest regularly: Like every investment scheme, crowdfunding lending works best if one can invest regularly and build a portfolio over a period of time. Crowdlending lets investors earn monthly returns through EMIs' and the benefits of compound interests can be availed if an investor is investing regularly through crowdfunding platforms.</p>

<p>6. Reap technological benefits: In modern times, it will be foolhardy to ignore the benefits that technology can bring into our lives. A good crowdlending platform provides for all information that a lender needs about a borrower, all his documents online and even manages monthly repayments. The lender is free to access all of this at any point of time which gives him complete control over his funds. Remember, for a good crowdfunding site both investor and borrower protection will be paramount.</p>

<p>7. Make the right choice: There are different types of crowdfunding like donation-based crowdfunding, reward-based crowdfunding, equity-based crowdfunding and Debt crowdfunding. While the entire bouquet of services may not be available in every crowdfunding site, as an individual lender you should be able to pinpoint what works for you. Choose something you can understand and do a thorough research on it. Lending to another individual falls under debt crowdfunding or P2P lending and this has seen a lot of traction in India. Lending to a customer and helping him in times of need or helping his business grow gives a lender tremendous sense of satisfaction. Peer -to- peer helps lenders and a borrower gain by eliminating high margins and benefits both segments.</p>

<p>In times of uncertainty, even large international banks have fallen like ninepins. The history of peer to peer lending is far more encouraging with negligible defaults. Investing smartly in a professionally managed technological platform can help one be a <a href="../../lender_registration/step1.html" target="_blank">smart investor</a>.</p>
