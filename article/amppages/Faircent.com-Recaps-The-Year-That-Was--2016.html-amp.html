    <p>No one could have predicted what 2016 had in store. From global shocks like Brexit and Trump to desi surprises like De-monetization, the year refused to end. The P2P lending sector kept waiting for the RBI regulations through the year and finally they should debut in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfazed by the shocks or the surprises, Faircent.com, India’s largest P2P lending platform, continued to grow from strength to strength.

<p>34% of our borrowers used their loan to expand and fund their businesses, creating more jobs and adding to the growth of our economy. 20% used it to consolidate their debts by accessing cheaper finance almost 5% used it to bring home a 2-wheeler or car. Many borrowers could fund medical emergencies, family events and undertake home improvement.</p>
