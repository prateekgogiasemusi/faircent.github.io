    <p><em>It’s that time of the year. Friends, and foes alike, are making furious plans to beat the summer heat. And most are thinking of doing it with elan, chilling in the lap of luxury. </em></p>

<p><em>And we ask: why should you be left out when your friends out there are seemingly having a good time? &nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>You could also have a summer break, high in style and soaked in flamboyance. With Faircent’s easy lending, you don’t have to worry about how to finance it. So, as you get your finances in order, we list a few luxe spots ideal for a summer break. </em></p>

<p><strong>Downton Abbey: </strong></p>

<p>Lush green meadows, chandelier-lit halls, magnificent upholstery, massive and ornate art-filled homes, sequinned dresses and old-world charm. If the Dowager and Carson’s antics left you wanting for more, there’s news in store. This year, you could relive the era gone by on your own by paying a visit yourself to the Highclere Castle, where most of ‘Downton’ was filmed. About 45 miles away from London, the castle is open to the public 60 to 70 days a year in spring and summer. While advance tickets (£22.00) to tour the mansion are all sold out for this year, there are still some walk-up tickets (£15.00) available.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s Chile:</strong></p>

<p>Forget Europe and North America this summer. If you are willing to explore luxe away from the regular, it’s time to head to Chile &amp; enjoy its mountains, desert, ocean, fjords, glaciers, lakes and volcanoes. You could start with a helicopter ride of the Loma Larga vineyard which produces the Malbec, a 93-point 2010 Cabernet Franc. A helicopter tour of the wine valley will set you back by US$456 but the scenic beauty will make up for it. And if you want some alone-time, you could head to the island of Chiloé on a yacht. Three-night, four-day cruises will transport you to the most remote parts of the archipelago, soaking in the scenic beauty of the churches and local cuisines.</p>

<p><strong>With Love, From The Alps: </strong></p>

<p>If you want to re-discover love this summer, head to the Badrutt’s Palace at St. Moritz in Switzerland. For all Yash Chopra fans, this is where the reel meets the real, and you can rekindle old flames. At $5,427 per night, you can use the wellness spa and shed some flab at the fitness center. Other goodies include moonlit or torch-light skiing, half-pipe snowboarding, tobogganing, vertical ice-wall climbing. For the uninitiated, St. Moritz hosted the 1928 Winter Olympics.</p>

<p><strong>Luxury On Track:</strong></p>

<p>For the homebird who doesn’t want to go overseas for a luxury-filled vacation, there is luxe here. Replete with dining cars, lounges, bar and library, the ‘Palace On Wheels’ can be called luxury in motion. In a span of eight days, the PoW lets you soak in the beauty of Jaipur, Chittorgarh, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bharatpur and Agra. At Rs 39000 a night, this promises to be a journey that marries romance, nostalgia and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>And when it comes to funding any or all of the above expeditions, worry not. Not just travel finance, there is now peer-2-peer (P2P) lending available too. We have listed some pointers for you to help you choose:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>What is travel finance?</strong></p>

<p>Travel Finance is a personal loan granted by a bank at its sole discretion for the purpose of financing a trip within India and abroad.</p>

<p><strong>What is P2P lending?</strong></p>

<p>Peer-to-peer lending is a loan granted&nbsp;to individuals or businesses through an online service(s) that connects lenders directly with borrowers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do I need to pledge or provide any security?</strong></p>

<p>For a personal loan from a bank, you do not need to pledge or provide any security. You may have to furnish references though.</p>

<p>While borrowing from a P2P network, you don’t need to pledge or provide any security. The network will connect you directly with potential lenders hence removing any intermediary cost.</p>

<p><strong>Am I eligible for a personal loan?</strong></p>

<p>Every bank has its own conditions for granting a personal loan. The eligibility criterion is listed on the bank website.</p>

<p>Before connecting lenders and borrowers, a P2P network does its homework. In other words, it will check your intention, stability and ability to take and payback the loan.</p>

<p><strong>What are the costs of the loan?</strong></p>

<p>The bank, while furnishing a loan, charges an upfront processing fee of 2 per cent of the loan amount. The loan is repayable in equated monthly installments (EMI) over the loan period.</p>

<p>If you are borrowing from a P2P network, the rate of interest is decided directly between the borrower and you. The model works on reverse auction empowering the borrower and making him an equal to the lender. After studying your profile and requirement listed on the website the lender makes an offer which you can reject, accept or even make a counter offer. Thus, credit worthy buyers are much in demand in this marketplace and can enjoy extremely low interest rates on their loans (starts at 12%)</p>

<p><strong>Can I pay the loan in advance?</strong></p>

<p>You can pay back the loan in advance. However, a prepayment fee of 2 per cent will be payable on the amount being paid in advance. Also, part pre-payment of the loan is not allowed.</p>

<p>In comparison, P2P doesn’t have any prepayment charges and allows part pre-payment at no additional charge.</p>

<p><strong><em>Reach out to a P2Pnetwork, now!</em></strong></p>
