    <p>You are just months away from turning 30. You are also the only one in your girly-gang who is yet to tie the knot. Almost all married friends are busy with their lives, leaving little time for the single you.</p>

<p>So what do you do to welcome your thirtydom? Do you sit in a corner of your 1BHK and mope around?</p>

<p>No. We list out FOUR things that you MUST do before you hit the 30-lane without worrying about the money.</p>

<p><strong>A few evenings in Paris</strong><br />
Do you remember that episode of ‘Sex and The City’ in which Carrie Bradshaw trotted to Paris? Well, you could also take a trip to the city of love, and discover laughter, cheese and coffee in its cafes, style in its fashion and magic in its people. And who knows, you could come back, with a partner in tow!</p>

<p><strong>Gift yourself an expensive handbag or a pair of heels!</strong><br />
You don’t go over- the- top when it comes to #shopping. But then your thirtieth is reason enough to splurge. Forget the sale hampers – instead, go and get a pair of Jimmy Choos or a set of Christian Louboutin red-bottomed heels. Top it up with a Salvatore Ferragamo clutch &amp; become an object of envy.</p>

<p><strong>Spend New Year’s Eve in New York City</strong><br />
The romantic in you is awakened every time you watch Garry Marshalls’ blockbuster ‘New Year’s Eve’. This year, before you turn 30, plan a trip to NYC and watch the world melt into one cultural mass. The streets are a visual feast as Lady Gaga, Beyonce and Ryan Seacrest fill the humungous TV screens. And then there is the giant Times Square Ball drop, too!</p>

<p><strong>Buy your first home before you turn 30...</strong><br />
Ah, well, at least book it – that won’t be too much of a financial drain - before you turn 30! If you have been staying away from home and paying (inflationary) rent, it’s time to look for a long-time solution. Make sure to book in a project that is near-completion and in which your EMIs begin only in a year’s time. Then wait for your friends to go envious at that housewarming of yours!</p>

<p><strong><em>And when it comes to funding any or all of the above expeditions, worry not. Now, there is peer-2-peer (P2P) lending available too. We have listed a few differences between P2P lending and personal loan that can help you take an informed decision.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>What is personal loan? What is P2P lending?</strong></p>

<p>A personal loan is granted by a bank at its sole discretion for the purpose of financing a personal need or requirement.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer lending is an online market place that connects lenders directly with borrowers thereby facilitating their loan requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are the costs of the loan?</strong></p>

<p>The bank, while furnishing a loan, charges an upfront processing fee of 2 per cent of the loan amount. The loan is repayable in equated monthly installments (EMI) over the loan period.</p>

<p>If you are borrowing from a P2P network, the rate of interest is decided directly between the borrower and you. The model works on reverse auction empowering the borrower and making him an equal to the lender. After studying your profile and requirement listed on the website the lender makes an offer which you can reject, accept or even make a counter offer. Thus, credit worthy buyers are much in demand in this marketplace and can enjoy extremely low interest rates on their loans (starts at 12%)</p>

<p><strong>Can I pay the loan in advance?</strong></p>

<p>You can pay back the loan in advance. However, a prepayment fee of 2 per cent will be payable on the amount being paid in advance. Also, part pre-payment of the loan is not allowed.</p>

<p>In comparison, P2P doesn’t have any prepayment charges and allows part pre-payment at no additional charge.</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for?</p>

<p><strong><em>Start thinking of how to ring in your 30<sup>th</sup>, in style! Reach out to a P2Pnetwork, now! </em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
