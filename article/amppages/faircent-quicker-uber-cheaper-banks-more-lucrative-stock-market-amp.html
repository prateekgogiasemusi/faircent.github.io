    <p>When your competitor has been doing business for decades, has built a mammoth infrastructure, works with an army of employees and to top it all, has built a billion dollar lending business, you need to have a disruptive business model to make a dent. Faircent, a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform, says it has what it takes to take on big banks.</p>

<p>Launched in mid 2014 as an alternative lending startup, Faircent has been gaining traction by lowering the cost of borrowing through eliminating intermediaries like banks and other financial institutions. However, this fintech startup is now upping the ante by playing on its strengths.</p>

<p>"What makes Faircent hot is our leadership in thought, data and technology. With consumers becoming more comfortable using technology over human interface, technology-enabled solutions need to outpace human-based solutions in product development. This will be our core focus area for 2017," says Rajat Gandhi, founder and CEO of Faircent.</p>

<p>A match made in Faircent</p>

<p>The company is getting ready to introduce what it calls 'Robo-Lending' by next year, which is going to act as a matchmaker for borrowers and lenders. A fully-automated feature, it is going to match lender investment criteria with borrower requirements and sends proposals on behalf of the lender to the borrower.</p>

<p>"This process not only ensures real-time investment and funding, but also helps the lender save time and effort required to build a diversified portfolio important to earn higher returns. Pooling in lender money into an online wallet from where they can easily invest across the platform is another soon-to-launch facility. At the heart of all this product development is customer ease and experience," explains Gandhi.</p>

<p>Ease for lenders, diversity for borrowers</p>

<p>Given that it allows the lenders to choose and create their own portfolio (higher risk borrowers pay a higher rate and vice versa), the platform has also evolved as an investment option for lenders. This is an aspect which is a high priority area for the startup as a way to get more lenders on the platform. Faircent recently partnered with Baxi, the on-demand bike taxi to enable its drivers to fund their two- wheelers through seeking loans through Faircent.</p>

<p>"With this product, lenders registered on Faircent now have an additional investment product. Faircent will continue to innovate with newer product offerings with greater focus on collateral backed lending products," says Gandhi, claiming that Faircent is the first P2P lending platform to launch collateral backed loans.</p>

<p>Gandhi claims that Faircent now has over 6,000 registered lenders and 30,000 registered borrowers and adding 3,000 more every month. The company witnesses on an average Rs 1 crore worth of loan transactions every month with Rs 2 lakh being the average ticket size of the loans. In the last two years of its operations, Gandhi claims to have disbursed more than Rs 10 crore of loans.</p>

<p>Predicting that the P2P lending market will grow to a size of $ 4-5 billion in the next 5-6 years, Gandhi says his objective is to make the process at Faircent more efficient to reach its aim of disbursing Rs 400 crore of loans in the next two-three years.</p>

<p>"Our aim is to make loan approvals faster than an Uber comes to your door and we plan to make it a reality by next year," says Gandhi.</p>

<p>While Faircent's mission is to make the loan process easier and faster, the startup is looking towards the regulator to foster the right ecosystem for P2P lending to develop.</p>

<p>"These regulations need to create an ecosystem that has just enough safeguards in place to help build consumer trust and provide leverage to the platform to innovate and grow," says Gandhi in a message to the RBI.</p>

<p>The twin objective of Faircent is to democratise financial services in India and to provide varied asset-class to our lenders and for this, Gandhi has several initiatives on the horizon including loans against property, gold and other such products.</p>
