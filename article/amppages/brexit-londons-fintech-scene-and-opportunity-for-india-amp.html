    <p>Not as big as the Silicon Valley in scale, the UK’s startup scene has been interesting over the past few years. A big part of it was because of the economic downturn of 2009 and the resultant rise of the fintech startups. However, with the UK’s decision to leave the European Union (EU) after the shocked result of the referendum, what does it mean for the Fintech industry in the country?</p>

<p>For starters, it is well established that there will be a lot of uncertainty at least for the next two years. No one knows what the contours of the deal would be and this puts a huge question mark on the ability to do business.</p>

<p>The process of starting up itself is very difficult and to add socio-economic and political upheavals is to take the troubles of an entrepreneur to the next level.&nbsp; Based on an approximate and top down view of the UK Fintech sector E&amp;Y in a report says the industry currently generates about £20 billion in revenue annually.</p>

<p>This is surely going to take a beating in the days and months to come. This comes amidst a KPMG report pointing out that VC cash is drying up -with investment in UK fintech startups collapsed 41% in the first quarter of the year.</p>

<p>London’s rise as a fintech hub is closely linked to the fact that it is home to many financial services companies and the base of operations for many global banks. Big banks like Barclays have been at the center of fintech revolution, but it is likely that emerging companies will see less focus as big institutions get side tracked into handling the repercussions of Brexit.</p>

<p>What has also taken a beating is the perception of London being open and welcoming. The nature of the Brexit campaign has been vitriolic and acerbic and this has led to a lot of resentment among people in the country. This does not help foster the spirit of innovation and creativity.</p>

<p>The biggest problem, however, is what Brexit has resulted in. It has led to a great deal of uncertainty. No one knows what will be the impact and changes and this makes doing business tough. Startups and more so the investing community, do not like ambiguity. A startup maybe nimble enough to pivot and navigate their way through this, but for the investing community it does add to the risks they can surely avoid.</p>

<p>A Bloomberg story rightly states that it is an open secret among British venture capitalists that many of their funds would have never gotten off the ground without funding from the European Investment Fund -- the EU institution that pools billions in financing from European governments, the EU itself and a number of private banks, to fund investments.</p>

<p>The story goes on to quote data from Invest Europe, that between 2011 and 2015, the EIF committed 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion) to some 144 U.K.-based venture firms. That amounts to about 37 % of all venture funding raised in the U.K. during those years. This tap will, in all probability, run dry in the next few months.</p>

<p>So, where does that place India? India is poised in a very attractive and interesting place. The fintech sector in the country is slowly coming of age. I can state with some amount of conviction that in a matter of about two years the kind of innovation that we see in India is at par and even better than what we have around the world. Large financial institutions and banks have set up facilities in India to tap into startups who are doing some cutting edge work.</p>

<p>According to Tracxn, which is also a great fintech startup, 76 fintech companies were funded since July 2015 in 83 rounds. The total funding in fintech startups during the period was $862.5M. VC funding activity has been centered on a variety of business models, including mobile wallets, loan comparison, insurance aggregators, online lending, payment devices, payment gateway solutions, and personal finance management.&nbsp; While a large part of these startups operate from Mumbai, fintech startups with some stellar work under their belt have sprung from Chennai to Jaipur.</p>

<p>The beauty of our fintech startup is that while many are focusing on solving problems for India, most have the ability to be a global company. The flux created by Brexit should be used by Indian fintech startups to move in fast across Europe and the US. What will help is enabling regulations from the government. We have forward looking white papers in the alternative lending space and we should ensure they quickly become laws. Also, once payment banks and the NPCI launched the Unified Payments Interface reach their full potential, we should see further fillip to the sector.</p>

<p>It has been widely acknowledged that India is a bright spot in the world economy. The UK’s fintech space will be under pressure, but what will not change is that regulations in the UK will continue to be favourable and attractive to fintech startups. India on the other hand is a stable economy and home to some of the most innovative minds and that should be our calling.</p>
