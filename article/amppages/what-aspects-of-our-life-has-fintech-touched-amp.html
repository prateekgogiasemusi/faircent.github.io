    <p>Before the Wright brothers came up with the airplane, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin had taken to the skies with his airship or balloon. The airship was the culmination of man’s wish to fly, but Zeppelin had one problem. The airships did have technical problems and the airplane did come up on top, but the biggest issue for Zeppelin was that he was always hamstrung for money. Being the pioneer, his venture was risky and most did not want to touch it.&nbsp;<br />
Things are very different today.<br />
If you are active on social media or have browsed the news channels, the chances are you have heard about the Modobag – the world’s first motorized, rideable luggage. “Modobag combines the convenience of a standard suitcase with the innovation of personal transportability, GPRS-GSM tracking, and dual USB charging ports to create the world’s only motorized, smart and connected carry-on that gets you to your destination three times faster than the average walking speed, “ says the description on its website. If you want to take a look, watch this video:</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FG-ZSMfqoUU" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>he idea of a rideable luggague is super fun, but there are risks associated. For starters, we do not know if airports around the world would like people zipping around in motorized luggage. Secondly, the product is not very light and thirdly it will cost about $1500 when it retails, which is about Rs. 1 lakh. However, what is interesting is the source of funds for the startup.&nbsp;<br />
The startup has turned to the hugely popular crowdfunding platform Indiegogo to raise money. From a flexible target of $50000 that it wanted to raise, the startup has raised about 500% more at $244,344. About 5-6 years earlier the startup would have found it difficult to raise money from your sources of finance like angels and VCS. With crowdfunding hundreds of startups are now making products from smart ideas by asking contributions from the public or the corwd. All may not be winners, but some ideas can surely be revolutionary.&nbsp;<br />
Crowdfunding is one part of what we today call as fintech, which is primarily the marriage of finance and technology. Most of the time we do not realize the extent fintech has started affecting our lives - both directly and indirectly.&nbsp;<br />
Everything from a startup raising money, an individual getting loan, seeking information, transferring money, investing are all undergoing a radical shift. Fintech has become large, but to get a better understanding it can be divided into:<br />
Payments – These are the firms developing the next generation of payment systems. These include startups and even non-payment tech companies like Facebook, Apple and Samsung. From inward remittances, processing salary, direct debits, electronic funds transfer to cheque imaging, the payments industry is seeing rapid transformation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mobile payments – This is perhaps the most visible form of fintech. Not related to debit or credit card, cash, cheque or drafts, the solutions in the mobile payments space specialize in cashless transactions. &nbsp;The ubiquitous mobile has become a great tool to pay for services and products and mobile wallets are a good example of this.&nbsp;<br />
Insurance- India has huge parts of its population without any form of insurance. Traditional systems have meant insurers find it hard to reach and offer the right product beyond a certain threshold of people. Fintech is playing a crucial role in risk assessment, coming up with the right product and enabling greater reach. Much of this is happening in the back-end and hence not very visible.&nbsp;<br />
Crowdfunding – As evident from the Modobag, crowdfunding mobilizes small contributions from the public towards the larger goal of raising a certain amount. Crowdfunding has proved to be a great vehicle to raise money for arts, social cause and even idiosyncratic business ideas.&nbsp;<br />
Alternative lending – This is hugely exciting segment of fintech and one that is creating the maximum buzz. Aspects like peer-to-peer lending that connects an individual borrower with an individual lender have seen a lot of attention. The segment is quickly catching the fancy of people around the world and has proved to be quite a revelation.&nbsp;<br />
There are other fintech systems like in consumer finance that include investing and the entire game around robo-advisors, enterprise finance, Bitcoin and in Forex that are having a profound impact on how we go about our lives. As a segment, fintech is about half a decade old, but has made rapid strides. We may not realize it, but fintech is quickly having an indelible and profound impact on our lives.&nbsp;<br />
